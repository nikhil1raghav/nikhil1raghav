### Hi, I'm Nikhil :wave:

I'm a student currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Engineering at [JC Bose University](https://jcboseust.ac.in). I love solving algorithmic problems, graphic designing, working with Jamstack(JS, APIs+Markup) ,ricing linux and learning new open source tools in free time to make life easier.
